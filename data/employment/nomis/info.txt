About this dataset

An employer survey of the number of jobs held by employees broken down by full/part-time and detailed industry (5 digit SIC2007). The survey records a job at the location of an employees workplace. Available from country down to lower level super output area and Scottish datazone.

The figures include businesses registered for PAYE but not for VAT, so are not continuous with BRES datasets for years prior to 2015.  A fuller note on the inclusion of PAYE-only businesses is provided in the BRES News article published on 2 October 2017 at https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/articles/1062.aspx

Information:
Employees: An employee is anyone aged 16 years or over that an organisation directly pays from its payroll(s), in return for carrying out a full-time or part-time job or being on a training scheme. It excludes voluntary workers, self-employed, working owners who are not paid via PAYE.

Full-time employees: those working more than 30 hours per week.
Part-time employees: those working 30 hours or less per week.

Employment includes employees plus the number of working owners. BRES therefore includes self-employed workers as long as they are registered for VAT or Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) schemes. Self employed people not registered for these, along with HM Forces and Government Supported trainees are excluded.

Working owners are typically sole traders, sole proprietors or partners who receive drawings or a share of the profits.

The figures include businesses registered for PAYE but not for VAT, so are not continuous with BRES datasets for years prior to 2015.
